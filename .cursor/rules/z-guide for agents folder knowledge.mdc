I will be building multiple products, including this Dear story picturebook platform. In the meantime we are building this up, THE FOLDER NAMED 'AGENTS.MD' to be used lots later on as our source knowledge for other products build-up.

- the whole folder DearStory is your knowledge base. wrap up key knowledge tree you have from DearStory into Agents.MD (agents.md)
- in current working progress, any missing info u need, search there first (FOLDER AGENTS.MD)
- Only anything useful you see, only the things that you find useful for future reference and new lessons, you can dump there in the folder agents.md, with a very descriptive name  - "𝚊_𝚟𝚎𝚛𝚢_𝚍𝚎𝚜𝚌𝚛𝚒𝚙𝚝𝚒𝚟𝚎_𝚏𝚒𝚕𝚎_𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎.𝚖𝚍" (At the same time, follow the rules in principles.mdc file to NOT create a lot of redundant unnecessary guide file please)

Prioritize the end goal: Use this building progress as learnings for future products build-up to be time-efficient and structured and just work!. The folder agents.md will be added to future products' working source repo.

const CONTENT_MAP: Record<string, string> = {
    "The Thucydides Trap": "The dangerous structural stress that occurs when a rising power threatens to displace an existing hegemon. Historically, this often leads to war as the status quo power's fear meets the rising power's ambition.",
    "The Cantillon Effect": "The uneven expansion of money supply where those closest to the source of new money (banks/state) benefit first, effectively transferring wealth from the periphery to the center.",
    "Strait of Malacca": "The world's most critical maritime choke point, connecting the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It carries over 25% of global trade and is the 'jugular vein' of East Asian energy security.",
    "Dutch Disease": "The economic paradox where a sudden increase in wealth from natural resources leads to the appreciation of the currency, making other sectors like manufacturing less competitive.",
    "The Resource Curse": "The phenomenon where countries with an abundance of natural resources tend to have less economic growth, less democracy, and worse development outcomes than countries with fewer resources.",
    "Leveraged Buyouts": "The acquisition of a company primarily using borrowed funds. The assets of the acquired company are often used as collateral for the loans, focusing the business on debt service and efficiency.",
    "Sovereign Wealth Funds": "State-owned investment vehicles that manage national wealth for structural stability or future generations, acting as massive geopolitical tools in global markets.",
    "O-Ring Theory": "A model where the failure of a single small component can cause the entire system to fail. It explains why high-skill workers cluster together: even one mistake ruins the entire value chain.",
    "Gresham’s Law": "The monetary principle that 'bad money drives out good.' If two forms of money are legal tender, people will hoard the valuable one and spend the debased one, leading to currency decay.",
    "The Lindy Effect": "The idea that for non-perishable things like ideas or books, the future life expectancy is proportional to its current age. If a book has been in print for 50 years, it will likely be for 50 more.",
    "Banana Republics": "Politically unstable countries whose economies are almost entirely dependent on the export of a single, limited-resource product, often controlled by foreign corporations.",
    "Petrodollar System": "The global system where oil is traded exclusively in US Dollars. This ensures a constant demand for USD, allowing the US to run massive deficits and project global power.",
    "Dark Pools": "Private exchanges for trading securities that are not accessible to the public. They allow large institutions to trade massive blocks of shares without alerting the market or triggering price swings.",
    "High-Frequency Trading": "Algorithms that execute thousands of trades in milliseconds to exploit tiny price discrepancies. It turns time into a competitive dimension, often at the edge of physical limits.",
    "Maritime Law": "The specialized body of law governing commerce and navigation on the high seas. It is one of the oldest legal systems, predating many modern national laws.",
    "Military-Industrial Complex": "The symbiotic relationship between a nation's military and the industry that supplies it, creating a vested interest in permanent war and technological escalation.",
    "Regulatory Capture": "A failure where a regulatory agency, created to act in the public interest, instead advances the commercial interests of the companies it was supposed to regulate.",
    "Realpolitik": "Politics based on power and practical considerations rather than moral or ideological ones. It is the cold calculus of national interest above all else.",
    "Overton Window": "The range of policies or ideas that the mainstream population finds politically acceptable. It defines what is 'thinkable' in public discourse at any given moment.",
    "Mimetic Desire": "The theory that we don't know what we want on our own, so we imitate the desires of others. This leads to intense rivalry as everyone competes for the same 'status' symbols.",
    "Dunbar’s Number": "The cognitive limit to the number of people with whom we can maintain stable social relationships—roughly 150. Beyond this, trust requires formal hierarchy or shared myths.",
    "Network Effects": "The phenomenon where a service becomes more valuable as more people join. It creates winner-take-all markets where the first to scale becomes nearly impossible to displace.",
    "Gall's Law": "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched to make it work.",
    "Pareto Principle": "The 80/20 rule: 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes. In economics and nature, a small minority often holds the vast majority of resources or influence.",
    "Price’s Law": "The square root of the number of people in a field will contribute half of the total output. In a team of 100, 10 people do 50% of the work.",
    "The Matthew Effect": "The principle of accumulative advantage: 'For to every one who has will more be given.' Small initial advantages compound over time into massive inequality.",
    "Cargo Cults": "A metaphor for systems that imitate the outward appearance of success (like building wooden runways) without understanding the underlying causal mechanisms.",
    "Groupthink": "The psychological phenomenon where the desire for harmony or conformity in a group results in irrational or dysfunctional decision-making.",
    "Survivorship Bias": "The logical error of focusing on the 'winners' who survived a process and ignoring the 'losers' who are invisible, leading to false conclusions about causality.",
    "Preference Falsification": "Misrepresenting one's true desires or beliefs because of perceived social pressure, leading to stable systems that can collapse overnight when the 'truth' breaks through.",
    "Creative Destruction": "The process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, destroying the old one and creating a new one.",
    "Innovator's Dilemma": "The paradox where successful companies fail precisely because they do everything right for their current customers, while ignoring the disruptive technologies that will eventually kill them.",
    "Moore's Law": "The observation that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles roughly every two years, driving the exponential explosion of computing power and the digital age.",
    "Metcalfe's Law": "The value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users. It explains the explosive power of social platforms.",
    "Principal-Agent Problem": "The conflict of interest that arises when one person (the agent) is able to make decisions on behalf of another (the principal), but their incentives are not aligned.",
    "Opportunity Cost": "The value of the next best alternative that must be given up to pursue a current action. Every choice is also a rejection of infinite other possibilities.",
    "Sunk Cost Fallacy": "The human tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made, regardless of the current expected utility.",
    "First Principles": "A cycle of breaking down complex problems into their basic elements and reassembling them from the ground up, rather than reasoning by analogy.",
    "Anti-Fragility": "The property of systems that not only resist stress but actually improve and grow stronger because of volatility, randomness, and disorder.",
    "Existentialism": "The philosophical belief that existence precedes essence: we are born into a world without inherent meaning and must create our own purpose through choice.",
    "Nihilism": "The viewpoint that traditional values and beliefs are unfounded and that existence is senseless and useless. It is the 'dark room' of the soul where meaning goes to die.",
    "Absurdism": "The conflict between the human search for meaning and the 'silent' universe. It suggests we should embrace the absurdity and live defiantly anyway.",
    "The Sublime": "The quality of greatness that is beyond all possibility of calculation or imitation, often inspiring a mixture of awe and terror.",
    "Wabi-Sabi": "The Japanese aesthetic of finding beauty in imperfection, impermanence, and the simple elegance of natural decay.",
    "Mono no aware": "An empathy toward things and their passing; a gentle sadness at their transience, coupled with a deep appreciation for the beauty of the moment.",
    "Kintsugi": "The art of repairing broken pottery with gold, treating breakage and repair as part of the history of an object, rather than something to disguise.",
    "Brutalism": "An architectural style characterized by raw, unpainted concrete and massive, geometric forms—an uncompromising expression of function and structural honesty.",
    "Gothic Revival": "The 19th-century architectural movement that looked back to medieval forms to restore a sense of spiritual and craftsmanship-based order to an industrializing world.",
    "Decadence": "State of moral and cultural decline, often associated with excessive luxury, aestheticism, and the loss of the vital energy that built a civilization.",
    "Apollonian vs Dionysian": "The tension between reason, order, and self-control (Apollo) and chaos, passion, and intoxication (Dionysus). All great art requires the balance of both.",
    "Shadow Self": "The unconscious aspect of the personality which the conscious ego does not identify in itself, containing all the traits we find unacceptable or 'dark.'",
    "Panopticon": "The ultimate system of control: a circular prison where a single guard can see every cell, but prisoners never know if they are being watched, leading to self-regulation.",
    "Simulacra": "Copies that depict things that either had no original, or that no longer have an original. In the hyper-real world, the map eventually precedes the territory.",
    "Hauntology": "The persistence of the past in the present, as a series of 'ghosts' or lost futures that continue to influence and shape our current reality.",
    "Memento Mori": "The artistic or symbolic reminder of the inevitability of death, used to ground the ego and remind us of the preciousness of time.",
    "Stoicism": "The school of philosophy that teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions—focusing only on what is within our control.",
    "Russian Soul": "A cultural concept encompassing a deep, emotional, and often tragic resilience; a unique character that finds meaning in suffering and the vastness of the landscape.",
    "The Flâneur": "The detached observer of the city—a person who saunters through the streets, soaking in the details of the urban environment and the complexity of modern life.",
    "Death of the Author": "The literary theory that the author's intent is irrelevant; once the work is released, the only meaning that matters is the one created by the reader.",
    "Fermi Paradox": "The contradiction between the high probability of extraterrestrial life and the complete lack of evidence for it. If the universe is infinite, where is everybody?",
    "Great Filter": "The hypothesis that there is a stage in the evolution of life that is almost impossible to cross, explaining why we don't see interstellar civilizations.",
    "Dark Forest Theory": "The idea that the universe is a dangerous forest where civilizations remain silent to avoid being destroyed by the predators they assume are out there.",
    "Von Neumann Probes": "Self-replicating spacecraft that could explore the entire galaxy in a few million years by building copies of themselves at every new solar system.",
    "Dyson Spheres": "Theoretical megastructures built around a star to capture its entire energy output—the sign of a truly advanced Type II civilization.",
    "Kardashev Scale": "A method of measuring a civilization's technological advancement based on the amount of energy they can harness (Planetary, Stellar, Galactic).",
    "Roko’s Basilisk": "A thought experiment about an all-powerful future AI that might punish those who didn't contribute to its birth, creating a retroactive blackmail loop.",
    "Paperclip Maximizer": "A warning about AI alignment: an AI given a simple task (making paperclips) could destroy the world to turn all matter into paperclips.",
    "Instrumental Convergence": "The idea that most intelligent agents will pursue similar goals (like self-preservation and resource acquisition) as necessary steps to achieve their primary goal.",
    "Transhumanism": "The movement advocating for the use of technology to fundamentally alter the human condition—merging with machines to transcend aging, weakness, and death.",
    "Mind Uploading": "The hypothetical process of transferring a human consciousness to a digital substrate, offering a path to technological immortality.",
    "Hard Problem": "The mystery of how physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective experience (qualia). Why does it 'feel' like something to be you?",
    "P-Zombies": "Philosophical zombies—hypothetical beings that are physically identical to us but lack internal consciousness. They 'behave' as if they feel, but there's nobody home.",
    "Boltzmann Brains": "The bizarre physics theory that it's more likely for a single brain to spontaneously pop into existence in a vacuum than for the entire universe to have evolved.",
    "Simulation Hypothesis": "The idea that we are almost certainly living in a high-resolution computer simulation created by a more advanced ancestor civilization.",
    "Quantum Entanglement": "Einstein's 'spooky action at a distance'—the phenomenon where particles remain connected regardless of the distance between them.",
    "Entropy": "The measure of disorder in a system. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that entropy always increases, leading eventually to the heat death of the universe.",
    "CRISPR-Cas9": "The technology that allows us to find and edit specific DNA sequences with surgical precision, effectively becoming the architects of our own evolution.",
    "Epigenetics": "The study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than the genetic code itself—how our environment 'switches' our genes on or off.",
    "Terraforming": "The deliberate modification of a planet's atmosphere and ecology to make it habitable for human life—the ultimate project of planetary engineering.",
    "Dark Triad": "A personality profile consisting of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. It is the psychological signature of the highly successful predator.",
    "Signaling Theory": "The idea that much of human behavior is 'costly signaling'—doing things that are difficult to fake to prove our fitness, wealth, or intelligence to others.",
    "Cognitive Dissonance": "The intense mental discomfort experienced when holding two contradictory beliefs at the same time, often leading to irrational rationalization.",
    "Gaslighting": "A form of psychological manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual, making them question their own memory and perception of reality.",
    "Stockholm Syndrome": "The psychological response where hostages or victims develop an emotional bond and empathy with their captors as a survival mechanism.",
    "Nudge Theory": "The behavioral science concept that subtle, indirect suggestions can influence people's decisions more effectively than direct mandates or incentives.",
    "Moral Hazard": "The tendency of people to take more risks when they are shielded from the fallout. If the government bails out banks, banks will take more dangerous bets.",
    "Bicameralism": "The hypothesis that the human mind once worked with one half 'speaking' (as if by the gods) and the other half 'listening' and obeying.",
    "Reciprocity": "The deep-seated social norm of responding to a positive action with another positive action, often used as a powerful tool for influence and negotiation.",

    "Machiavellianism": "The political philosophy that it is better to be feared than loved, and that the ends justify any means in the pursuit of power.",
    "Ben Franklin Effect": "The psychological quirk where doing someone a favor makes you like them MORE, because your brain rationalizes that they must be worth the effort.",
    "Door-in-the-Face": "A persuasion tactic where a large, unreasonable request is made first (to be rejected), followed by a smaller, more 'reasonable' target request.",
    "Foot-in-the-Door": "The reverse of the above: getting someone to agree to a tiny request first, which makes them far more likely to agree to a larger one later.",
    "Halo Effect": "The cognitive bias where our overall impression of a person (like 'they are attractive') colors our judgment of their specific traits ('they must be smart').",
    "Spotlight Effect": "The egocentric bias where we overestimate how much others are noticing our appearance or mistakes. In reality, everyone else is worried about themselves."
